## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

### âœ… Normalizr
- Explain the purpose of Normalizr.
- Normalize deeply nested JSON data using `schema.Entity`, `schema.Array`, and `normalize`.
- Use normalized data in Redux state for easier updates and lookups.

### âœ… Redux Core Concepts
- Describe Redux architecture: store, actions, reducers, middleware.
- Understand the unidirectional data flow in Redux applications.

### âœ… Redux Actions & Action Creators
- Define Redux actions using constants and payloads.
- Write action creators as functions returning actions.

### âœ… Async Actions with Thunk
- Use redux-thunk middleware for async operations (e.g., API requests).
- Handle loading, success, and failure states via dispatched actions.
- Understand how async action creators enable side effects in Redux.

### âœ… Normalizing State Shape
- Convert nested API responses into flat, normalized state.
- Store entities in `{ byId, allIds }` format for scalable and maintainable Redux state.

### âœ… Testing Redux Logic
- Write unit tests for reducers (pure functions).
- Use `redux-mock-store` to test action creators and dispatched action sequences.
- Test selectors and derived data.

## âœ… Project Setup

```bash
npm install redux react-redux redux-thunk normalizr
npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

Ensure .babelrc or babel.config.js is configured with:

js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react'],
};
