# 0x03. React Component

> ALX Front-End Engineer Project

This project focuses on building, testing, and optimizing React components using both class-based and functional approaches. You'll dive deep into component lifecycles, performance optimizations, Jest & Enzyme testing, and explore advanced concepts like Higher-Order Components (HOCs).

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

### 1. 🧱 Class vs Function Components
- Understand differences and use-cases.
- Refactor class components into function components using hooks.

### 2. 🔁 Lifecycle of a Class Component
- Implement `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`, etc.
- Manage data fetching, subscriptions, and cleanups effectively.

### 3. 🧪 Testing React Components
- Use Jest & Enzyme to:
  - Shallow render and mount components.
  - Simulate user interactions and assert UI updates.
  - Test component state, props, and conditional rendering.

### 4. 👀 Jest Spy Functions
- Use `jest.fn()` to track and mock function calls.
- Spy on component methods to verify behavior.

### 5. 🔁 Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
- Build reusable HOCs to share logic between components.
- Understand benefits over repetition or hooks alone.

### 6. ⚡ Performance Optimization
- Use `React.PureComponent` or `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Understand React’s rendering and reconciliation processes.
- Profile components using React Developer Tools.

### 7. ✅ Clean Code & Best Practices
- Structure components cleanly using prop validation (`PropTypes` or TypeScript).
- Clean up listeners and side effects.
- Write reusable and maintainable code.

## ✅ Requirements

- All files are interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **Node.js 12.x** and **npm 6.x**.
- All files must end with a new line.
- README.md file is mandatory.
- Use `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, or `Visual Studio Code` for development.
